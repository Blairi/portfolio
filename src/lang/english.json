    "bio": "I studied in a technical high school where I studied: 'Programming Technician'. During the preparation I learned to program from flowcharts with DFD, web pages, to creating mobile applications with Java. At the end of my studies in the preparation I decided to expand my knowledge and I studied web development with internet courses, with a good programming base, it was easy for me to adapt. Now I am studying engineering where I take programming subjects such as data structures, algorithms and others.",
