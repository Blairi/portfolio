    "bio": "I studied in a technical high school where studied: 'Programming Technician'. During high school, I learned to program from flowcharts with DFD, and web pages, to creating mobile applications with Java. At the end of my studies in high school, I decided to expand my knowledge and studied web development with internet courses, with a good programming base, it was easy for me to understand the concepts. Now I'm studying engineering and taking computer science courses such as data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, and more.",
